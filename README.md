# Gifhub

## Purpose

Born in Seattle on a January night out. This is a PWA for viewing locally saved gif and images. Gif and image links are entered and the underlying data is saved as a blob to IndexedDB. Users assign these blobs to playlists and view them in the SwiperJS player

There is a connection to a service for converting video links to clipped Gifs https://github.com/B12Howard/gifcreator, you will need to be authenticated to used it.

## What is being used
IndexedDB (via Dexie wrapper)
Firebse Auth
